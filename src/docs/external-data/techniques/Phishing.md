# Phishing

## Description

### MITRE Description

> Adversaries may send phishing messages to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.

Adversaries may send victimâ€™s emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems or to gather credentials for use of [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078). Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms.
