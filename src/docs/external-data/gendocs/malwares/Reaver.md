## Description

### MITRE Description

> [Reaver](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0172) is a malware family that has been in the wild since at least late 2016. Reporting indicates victims have primarily been associated with the "Five Poisons," which are movements the Chinese government considers dangerous. The type of malware is rare due to its final payload being in the form of [Control Panel Items](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1196). (Citation: Palo Alto Reaver Nov 2017)
