# Startup Items Mitigation

## Description

### MITRE Description

> Since StartupItems are deprecated, preventing all users from writing to the <code>/Library/StartupItems</code> directory would prevent any startup items from getting registered. Similarly, appropriate permissions should be applied such that only specific users can edit the startup items so that they canâ€™t be leveraged for privilege escalation.
