# Sudo Mitigation

## Description

### MITRE Description

> The sudoers file should be strictly edited such that passwords are always required and that users canâ€™t spawn risky processes as users with higher privilege. By requiring a password, even if an adversary can get terminal access, they must know the password to run anything in the sudoers file.
