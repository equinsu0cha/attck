# Browser Extensions Mitigation

## Description

### MITRE Description

> Only install browser extensions from trusted sources that can be verified. Ensure extensions that are installed are the intended ones as many malicious extensions will masquerade as legitimate ones.

Browser extensions for some browsers can be controlled through Group Policy. Set a browser extension white or black list as appropriate for your security policy. (Citation: Technospot Chrome Extensions GP)

Change settings to prevent the browser from installing extensions without sufficient permissions.

Close out all browser sessions when finished using them.
