# Supply Chain Compromise Mitigation

## Description

### MITRE Description

> Apply supply chain risk management (SCRM) practices and procedures (Citation: MITRE SE Guide 2014), such as supply chain analysis and appropriate risk management, throughout the life-cycle of a system.

Leverage established software development lifecycle (SDLC) practices (Citation: NIST Supply Chain 2012): 

* Uniquely Identify Supply Chain Elements, Processes, and Actors
* Limit Access and Exposure within the Supply Chain
* Establish and Maintain the Provenance of Elements, Processes, Tools, and Data
* Share Information within Strict Limits
* Perform SCRM Awareness and Training
* Use Defensive Design for Systems, Elements, and Processes
* Perform Continuous Integrator Review
* Strengthen Delivery Mechanisms
* Assure Sustainment Activities and Processes
* Manage Disposal and Final Disposition Activities throughout the System or Element Life Cycle

A patch management process should be implemented to check unused dependencies, unmaintained and/or previously vulnerable dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation. Continuous monitoring of vulnerability sources and the use of automatic and manual code review tools should also be implemented as well. (Citation: OWASP Top 10 2017)
