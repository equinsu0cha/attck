# Brute Force Mitigation

## Description

### MITRE Description

> Set account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed. 
Too strict a policy can create a denial of service condition and render environments un-usable, with all accounts being locked-out permanently. Use multifactor authentication. Follow best practices for mitigating access to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)

Refer to NIST guidelines when creating passwords.(Citation: NIST 800-63-3)

Where possible, also enable multi factor authentication on external facing services.
