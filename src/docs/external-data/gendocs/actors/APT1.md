## Targets

```
U.S. cybersecurity firm Mandiant, later purchased by FireEye, released a report in February 2013 that exposed one of China's cyber espionage units, Unit 61398. The group, which FireEye called APT1, is a unit within China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) that has been linked to a wide range of cyber operations targeting U.S. private sector entities for espionage purposes. The comprehensive report detailed evidence connecting APT1 and the PLA, offered insight into APT1's operational malware and methodologies, and provided timelines of the espionage it conducted.
